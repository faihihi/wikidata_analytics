Before running the server, do the following
1) Run 'npm install' on root directory
2) Go to /app/import/ in importJSON.js, change directoryPath (line 3) to the path of directory where JSON files are located
3) In the same directory in update.js, change path (line 5) to path of directory where all admin_...txt and bot.txt are located
4) In terminal, cd to /app/import and run 'node importJSON.js'
5) cd to /app/models/update and run 'node update.js'
6) Run the server, you can run with 'node server.js' or 'npm start'
	**npm start is enabled by the nodemon module, I added it because it automatically run the server whenever changes in the codes are made. So you don't have to run 'node server.js' every time you update the file
